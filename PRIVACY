Privacy Policy

PlainSight does not collect or store any personally identifiable information 
about its users. The only data stored by this software is the password entered 
by the user as well as a few other settings specific to the extension. 
PlainSight has access to the contents of any page the user loads in their 
browser once the extension is activated, but NONE of this data is collected 
or stored and this access is used strictly for core extension functionality 
(encrypting and decrypting messages).
